Liquidart is a modern Dart HTTP server framework. The framework is composed of libraries for handling and routing HTTP requests, object-relational mapping (ORM), authentication and authorization (OAuth 2.0 provider) and documentation (OpenAPI). These libraries are used to build scalable REST APIs that run on the Dart VM.
